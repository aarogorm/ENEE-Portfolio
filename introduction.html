      <h3 class="intro-text">My name’s Aaron Gorman and I am a sophomore computer science major here at UMD. I am from Grand Rapids, MI initially, but I’ve been living on Kent Island in Maryland for the last 17 years of my life. I like to play the guitar and I made this website that you are on right now from scratch!

          If I had to choose the most fun thing that I have done in the past year, I’d have to go with the trip that I went on in January with the University’s Ski/Snowboard club, Terpski. We went to Killington, VT to shred Killington Ski Resort for five days, staying in condos right next to the mountain for five nights. As a snowboarder of 10 years who has gotten tired of smaller mountains in Pennsylvania, this was a breath of fresh air for me.

          As for something my friends ask me for help with; that would have to be coding. A few of my friends here already have had to take different coding classes and they always seem to come to me for help. Right now, I’m helping my roommate through his coding for physics class, and I’ve helped him so much he has proposed a plan to apply for a physics coding internship on campus, but he wants me to be his arms and he’s the face (Weekend at Bernie’s Style). I don’t think this is going to work out, but we’ll see where that goes.
          <br><br>
        	In group situations, I would definitely see myself as the entertainer. I physically cannot go more than five minutes in a group of people without making jokes and lightening the mood if it needs to be. When I’m able to keep myself from doing that, I often end up playing the guitar in my free time.
          <br><br>
          This course is relevant to me in the sense that ethics are a huge responsibility that programmers have to be aware of due to the nature of the software development field today. Whether it is being inclusive in website design so people with disabilities (color blindness, blindness, deafness, etc.) are able to experience the site if that is a possible audience or making sure technology that recognizes people isn’t discriminatory based on skin color, ethics are often present.
          <br><br>
          My impression of ethics before I entered this class was that they were basically the same thing as morals, which I have found out is not exactly the case. Before coming into the class, I also assumed there was only one type of ethics, as in something could be ethical, or it could be unethical. Since then I have learned that there are many different types of ethics, and something that is ethical to someone could be unethical to someone else. In other words, there is no universally accepted upon definition of what is and isn’t ethical.
          <br><br>
        	My plan for the semester is to put more work into my classes than I have in past semesters, so I can feel more fulfilled in my work. I hope to learn in this class specifically more about ethics that people wouldn’t commonly think of, which we have done some of already. I figured with an ethics class, it would be pretty standard talks about topics such as who should a self-driving car protect in the case of an accident or whether developing military weapons is ethical, but I really want to learn about the less heard of and less talked about ethical cases. In relation to other classes, I hope to be able to incorporate website building and other coding practices into projects that I have to do in there as well so I can get more creative with mundane assignments and keep them interesting.
